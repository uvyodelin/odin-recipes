      Chicken Aglio Pasta is a delicious and satisfying Italian dish that
      combines tender chicken pieces with al dente pasta and a flavorful
      garlic-infused olive oil sauce. The name "aglio" comes from the Italian
      word for garlic, which is a key ingredient in this dish, along with olive
      oil and sometimes chili flakes for a hint of spice.
